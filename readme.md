## Overview
This repository contains the following files:

- **run_attack.sh** - For generating attack files using [textattack](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack) library.
- **Translation_EN-DE.py** -  For running proposed defense using EN-DE translation scheme.
- **Translation_EN-FR.py** -  For running proposed defense using EN-FR translation scheme.
- **Timer_Trans_DE.py** - For inference time comparision with and without the application of the proposed defense using EN-DE scheme.
- **Timer_Trans_FR.py** - For inference time comparision with and without the application of the proposed defense using EN-DE scheme.

Further details about the methodology may be directly referred to from the published study.
